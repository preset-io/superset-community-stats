* Scrape Threado for leaderboard material
* Scrape Slack for member numbers and activity

TODO (Process)
* Install Shillelagh and have it publish these stats to a GSheet
* Modify the Superset Community Dashboard to pull in these stats from the sheet
* Modify the ESLint job to _also_ use Shillelagh?
